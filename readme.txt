Helps conventions manage panel submissions including multiple submission stages.

== Description ==

This plugin was originally written for NDK (Nan Desu Kan) so early on versions will probably focus on functionality for that con. However, long term I'd like to open it up in order to make it useful for everyone and not just for panels but also for events such as AMV contests and similar (at least entry into those contests.)

One of the major problems we came across with running Panel submissions with our current method was tracking and maintaining panel submissions, making sure we didn't miss any, and getting solid information, getting emails sent out, seeing where people were in the process, all that. So I decided that writing a plugin was probably a good way to 1. Get back into programming and 2. Fix all that.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `PanelPlanner` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
